\opening{Dear Editors,}

We would like to thank you for offering us the opportunity to revise
and re-submit our paper entitled ``Software architectures to integrate
workflow engines in science gateways'' to Future Generation Computer
Systems.

The remainder of this letter contains our answer to the 3 reviews that
we received following the evaluation process. A revised version of the
manuscript follows, where corrected parts appear in blue for a better
identification. 

We thank you again for your time and consideration, and we remain available for any further information you may need.

Sincerely yours,
