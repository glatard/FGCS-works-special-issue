abstract="The motivation of this work fits with the general vision to enable e-health for European citizens, irrespective of their social and financial status and their place of residence. Services to be provided include access to a high-quality early diagnostic and prognostic service for the Alzheimer Disease and other forms of dementia, based both on the European Research and Education Networks and the European Grid Infrastructure. The present paper reports on the architecture and services of a Science Gateway developed in the context of the DECIDE project, which aims to support the medical community in its daily duties of patients' examination and diagnosis. The implementation of the Science Gateway is described with particular focus on the standard technologies adopted to ease the access by non IT-.expert users. The work leverages on an authentication and authorization infrastructure based on Identity Federations and robot certificates and on the adoption of the SAGA standard for middleware-independent Grid interaction. The architecture and the functionalities of the digital repository for medical image storage and analysis are also presented.",

abstract="The WS-PGRADE/gUSE generic DCI gateway framework has been developed to support a large variety of user communities. It provides a generic purpose, workflow-oriented graphical user interface to create and run workflows on various DCIs including clusters, Grids, desktop Grids and clouds. The framework can be used by NGIs to support small user communities who cannot afford to develop their own customized science gateway. The WS-PGRADE/gUSE framework also provides two API interfaces (Application Specific Module API and Remote API) to create application-specific science gateways according to the needs of different user communities. The paper describes in detail the workflow concept of WS-PGRADE, the DCI Bridge service that enables access to most of the popular European DCIs and the Application Specific Module and Remote API concepts to generate application-specific science gateways.",

abstract = "Abstract Modern science often requires the execution of large-scale, multi-stage simulation and data analysis pipelines to enable the study of complex systems. The amount of computation and data involved in these pipelines requires scalable workflow management systems that are able to reliably and efficiently coordinate and automate data movement and task execution on distributed computational resources: campus clusters, national cyberinfrastructures, and commercial and academic clouds. This paper describes the design, development and evolution of the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which maps abstract workflow descriptions onto distributed computing infrastructures. Pegasus has been used for more than twelve years by scientists in a wide variety of domains, including astronomy, seismology, bioinformatics, physics and others. This paper provides an integrated view of the Pegasus system, showing its capabilities that have been developed over time in response to application needs and to the evolution of the scientific computing platforms. The paper describes how Pegasus achieves reliable, scalable workflow execution across a wide variety of computing infrastructures. "
