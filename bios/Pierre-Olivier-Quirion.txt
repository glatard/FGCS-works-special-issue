Pierre-Olivier Quirion completed a PhD in Astrophysics in 2006. In all, he spent about ten years studying evolution and seismology of white dwarfs and solar like stars. He followed this period with a two years stint in the film industry, working has a Technical Director in charge of distributed computing in the dynamic environment of Computer Graphic Image (CGI) production. It is with this eclectic background, always lined with high performance computing, that Dr Quirion joined the CRIUGM in 2015 as a member of the SIMEXP, Neuropoly and UNF labs where he develops software for MRI analysis and distributed computing and act as a goto specialist for all things computer related.
